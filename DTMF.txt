Aim:   
To generate DTMF signals using MATLAB software 
Requirements: 
MATLAB  
Theory:  
Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) is a signaling technique used for telecommunication systems, especially in touch-tone telephones. DTMF works by generating two simultaneous sinusoidal signals, each at a different frequency, which represent each key on the telephone keypad. When a button is pressed, it produces a unique combination of two tones: one from a low-frequency group and the other from a high-frequency group. 
The frequency mapping of the DTMF keypad is as follows: 
  
To generate a DTMF signal in MATLAB, we use the following steps: 
1.	Define the low and high frequencies for the key pressed. 
2.	Create two sinusoidal signals corresponding to these frequencies. 
3.	Combine the two signals to generate the DTMF tone for the pressed key. 
For a given key, the generated signal y(t) can be expressed as:

Observation:  1. MATLAB Code Execution: 
MATLAB was used to generate the DTMF signal for each key by producing two sinusoidal tones corresponding to each key's low and high frequencies and then summing them to form the DTMF tone. 
2.	Frequency Verification: 
By plotting the resulting DTMF signals, distinct frequency components were observed, confirming the presence of both the low and high frequencies associated with each key press. 
3.	Audible Signal Generation: 
When played as an audio file, each DTMF tone sounded like a distinct dual-tone signal, characteristic of traditional telephone key presses. 
   
Conclusion:   
The DTMF signals for a telephone keypad were successfully generated in MATLAB by combining the appropriate low and high frequency tones for each key. This experiment demonstrates how DTMF signaling encodes numbers and symbols as combinations of specific frequencies, allowing for reliable and fast transmission of numeric data over communication systems. The MATLAB simulation of DTMF signals provides a practical understanding of telecommunication signaling methods. This approach is foundational in various telecommunication applications, such as telephone dialing and remote system control.
